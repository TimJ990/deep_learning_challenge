The purpose of this analysis is to compile, traind and evalute our neural network model with a goal accuracy of 75%+.
The variables that were our target was the "IS_SUCCESFUL" column.
The features would be all the other columns, everything not including "IS_SUCCESFUL."
We removed "EIN" and "NAME", we also dropped the low "T" and "C" values.
For optimziation 1 we had 83/30 neurons with two layers.
For optimization 2 we had 10/50/10 neurons with three layers.
for optimization 3 we had 120/55 neurons with two layers.
No,I was able to get close but never achieve 75% accuracy. 
I increased the layers for optimzation 2, and increased the neurons for optimization 3.
I would start with more layers and more neurons, and see if that helped. Optimization 3 yeilded a higher accuracy rate, so maybe adding the more layers would have increased our rate to be at or above our goal.
